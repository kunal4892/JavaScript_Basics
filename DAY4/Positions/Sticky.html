        The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow
        by providing commonly used dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels.
        There are two variants: 12 and 16 columns, which can be used separately
        or in tandem. Read more. Dimensions The 12-column grid is divided into
        portions that are 60 pixels wide. The 16-column grid consists of 40
        pixel increments. Each column has 10 pixels of margin on the left and
        right, which create 20 pixel wide gutters between columns. View demo.
        Purpose The premise of the system is ideally suited to rapid
        prototyping, but it would work equally well when integrated into a
        production environment. There are printable sketch sheets, design
        layouts, and a CSS file that have identical measurements.
